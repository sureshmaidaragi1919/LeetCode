1. Graph is a data structure contains data at nodes also called as vertex and this vertex attached by line called edge
2. There can be directed or undirected graph
3. Directed graph means there is direction given between two nodes/vertices
4. Undirected graph means there wont be any predefined directions between nodes
5. What is weighted graph ? A graph if it contains weight on every edge or any edges is called as weighted graph
6. What are different ways to store a graph :a. Using Matrix (n+1 nodes X m+1 edges) it is also called as adjency matrix b. using list called as adjency list
7. What is indegree and outdegree in graph?. It is applicable to only directed graph, hence if a graph node contains incoming edges are indegree of node if a graph contains outgoing eges are called outdegree of node
8. What is a edge weight in a graph
9. Undirected graph is always a cyclic graph if all nodes are connected.
10. What is a path in a graph?: If there is continuoue edges between given nodes then it is called as path
11. What is degree in a graph? :  it is number of nodes attached to it are called as degree of edge formula is D = 2*Edges
12. If we can't uniformly move across all the edge's and nodes then it is non-cyclic graph
13. What are connected components in a graph? : a graph can be collection of group of graph then it is called as connected components of graph,
14 A graph can contain single node too.
