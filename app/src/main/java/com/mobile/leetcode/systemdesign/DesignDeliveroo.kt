Design a platform through which we can distribute 6 million burgers in 5 minutes. Consider more than 20 million requests will fall on our system. One user can receive one burger only, no more than that.

Follow up: There are around 1 lakh coupons through which one user can get 1 extra burger along with the confirmed first burger.

Reverse Every Alternate N Nodes in Linked List
Medium
Given a linked list of integers and a positive integer N. Create a new linked list by reversing every alternate N nodes of the linked list. If the number of nodes in the list or in the last group is less than N, just reverse the remaining nodes.

Example:

linked list:  7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
N: 4

Output: 10 9 8 7 11 12 13 14 16 15
Reverse the first `N(4)` nodes and then skip the next `N(4)` nodes. Now, since the number of nodes remaining in the list (2) is less than `N`,then just reverse the remaining nodes (15 and 16).
